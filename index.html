                        <p>

                            <br> “The doctor said Xiaolei would die in his adolescence if he does not get treated”, Mrs. Chen Zhi said, “My husband and I do not have any symptom, but the doctor said we both carry recessive genes, so Xiaolei is suffering
                            from the illness.” Her three-year-old son Xiaolei is diagnosed with a rare disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), which account for one per 10000 population in China, according to <a href=" http://www.meier.org.cn/">Meier Advoacy & Support center for SMA</a>.

                            “Rarity” is not a rigorous medical concept for a disease, and China does not have a formal definition of rarity. By <a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/Ch6_19Rare.pdf">definition of European Union countries</a>,
                            any disease affecting fewer than five people in 10000 is considered rare. There are 6000 to 7000 unique rare diseases worldwide, each with causes, symptoms, and treatment have little in common beyond their rarity. Chinese Centre
                            for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5359347/ ">estimates</a> that China has the world’s largest number of people with rare diseases, the population is 16.8 million in 2014,
                            and the number is still increasing.

                            <br> Currently, Nosinassen Sodium Injection (Nosinassen), invented by Biogen Incorporation, is the only one that effectively treats SMA on the Chinese market. There are no alternatives. Pharmaceutical companies are often short
                            of interest for developing a product targeting a few patients. The drug for the rare disease is often called “Orphan Drug”, that are naturally scarce and expansive. For SMA, a dose of 5 ml Nosinassen costs 700,000 RMB, and
                            patients need to inject six doses the first year and three doses every following year.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Nosinassen is a self-funded drug in China now, but officials and pharmaceutical company offered a helping hand. On May 31, 2019, Primary Health Care Foundation of China launched an aid project for the SMA patients, with Biogen donated drugs to ease the
                            financial burden. The project could assist patients to save more than half of the medicine cost.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “We are lucky. Xiaolei is much better after injecting six doses of Nusinersen. He can grab my hand and stand up now.” Mrs. Chen said. With the aid program, Xiaolei has complete the first-year treatment and get subsidy for four injections, but the family
                            are also in massive debt with more than half a million.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even with the aiding, the annual treatment costs of SMA patients’ still exceed one million. “I just hope the drug can be included in the medical insurance next year,” Mrs. Chen said, “We cannot afford more.” Although the drug for SMA is available among
                            many rare diseases that even does not have a cure, the exorbitant price makes the majority of families could only choose the conservative treatment or even did not get any treatment at all.

                            Although the attention of rare disease in China started later, and there are still no special rare disease laws and policies at the national level, China has made breakthroughs in construct a rare disease care system. In 2018, with 121 diseases listed
                            under the newly published National Rare Disease List, great attention has drawn to rare diseases. And in the following year, The Ministry of Finance announced value added tax would be levied by 3% for imported and domestic
                            drugs for the first batch of 21 orphan drugs in February. Later that month, the Rare Diseases Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines were released, provided a professional guide for medical practitioners. In April, adjustment of
                            national medical insurance list was updated, stated the treatment of rare disease will be given priority.

                        <p>Among 121 rare diseases on National Rare Disease List, more than 50 drugs that are on the Chinese market and therapeutic, more than 40 have been included in medical insurance. But Nusinersen is not one of them due to the high cost.
                            Patients in a small number of provinces and cities, like Shenzhen, Zhejiang, Qingdao, that have guaranteed orphan drugs besides the national medical insurance list may get reimbursed. Still, Xiaolei did not born in these cities.

                            <br> “There is a conflict of interest between patients of ordinary disease and rare disease in the subject of which drug should be included in the national medical insurance system,” Prof. Dong Dong, School of Public Health
                            and Primary Care in Chinese University of Hong Kong said. “Would you agree to share your insurance money for a disease that you may never get?”

                            and Primary Care in Chinese University of Hong Kong said. She believe people are all self-interested, and a majority of public do not want to pay for the high-priced medicines for others. “Would you agree to share your insurance
                            money for a disease that you may never get?”

                        <p>“Rare disease patients often feel isolated, lack of social identity.” Prof. Dong said, although some of them may actively participated in patients organizations, they are still the unseen minority. “The key is public awareness.
                            You must create awareness and let the general public know the rare disease patients exists.” In 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on the internet, promoted awareness of the rare disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                            (ALS), and received millions of donations. “One must first see, then to care.”

                            <br> Rare diseases are only one step away from us. Not only there are around 20% of rare diseases that are caused by non-genetic factors, but for the generic cause, the disease is of certain probability. Just like Mrs. Chen
                            and her husband, an ordinal couple with both have recessive genes of SMA. Once both husband and wife are carriers, the probability of having an asymptomatic carrier is 50%, and the likelihood of having a healthy child or child
                            with SMA and is 25%.

                            <br>
                            <br> “To understand from the cause, rare disease is human’s problem, like Gene abnormality and mutations,” Prof. Wang Lin, National Health Commission of the PRC Committee of Experts on Rare Disease Diagnosis and Protection,
                            said in an <a href="http://hjb.bjyxh.org.cn/News/ViewList/28">interview</a> with Association For Medical Education, “Based on medical and biomolecular research, gene mutations are related to cancer and human ageing, and closely
                            related to the cause of rare disease.”
